# 1 Getting Started

## 1.1 Get Python

### 1.1.1 Download Python

&emsp;&emsp;Click <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/source/" target="_blank">Python.org/downloads/source</a> to download python source code.

### 1.1.2 Compile & Install Python

### 1.1.3 Set Alias `py`

1. Edit `~/.zshrc` and write the following configuration:

```zsh
alias py='python3'
```

2. Execute `source ~/.zshrc` to apply this configuration and then we would run `py` instead of `python3`.

## 1.2 REPL

&emsp;&emsp;Run the command `py` and we see the three arrows. This is the pyhton REPL.

```
Python 3.11.2 (main, Mar 13 2023, 12:18:29) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

&emsp;&emsp;REPL is an acronym that stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop.

&emsp;&emsp;We can just put in a command and execute it by pressing Enter. And we would exit it by typing `quit()` and then press Enter.

## 1.3 Hello World

1. Edit `hello.py`:

```pyhton
greeting = "Hello World!"
print(greeting)
```

2. Execute `py hello.py`
