# 1 HTML First Steps

## 1.1 Getting started with HTML

### 1.1.1 What is HTML?

&emsp;&emsp;HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages we visit.

&emsp;&emsp;HTML consists of a series of elements, which we use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.

&emsp;&emsp;If we wanted a text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph `<p>` element:

```html
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```

> Note: Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a `<title>` tag could be written as `<title>`, `<TITLE>`, `<Title>`, `<TiTlE>`, etc., and it will work. However, **it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability**.

### 1.1.2 Anatomy of an HTML element

&emsp;&emsp;The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.

The anatomy of our element is:

* The **opening tag**: Marks where the element begins or starts to take effect.
* The **content**: The content of the element.
* The **closing tag**: Marks where the element ends.

#### Nesting elements

#### Void elements

### 1.1.3 Attributes

Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:

![html_attribute](./images/html_attribute.png)

&emsp;&emsp;Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.

An attribute should have:

* A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)
* The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
* An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.
