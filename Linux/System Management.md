# 1 Some Basic Things

## 1.1 Introductory Terms and Concepts

### Binaries

&emsp;&emsp;This term refers to files that can be executed, similar to executables in Windows.

### Case sensitivity

&emsp;&emsp;Unlike Windows, the Linux filesystem is case sensitive. This means that Desktop is different from desktop, which is different from DeskTop. Each of these would represent a different file or directory name.

### Directory

&emsp;&emsp;This is the same as a folder in Windows. A directory provides a way of organizing files, usually in a hierarchical manner.

### Terminal

&emsp;&emsp;This is a command line interface (CLI).

## 1.2 The Linux Filesystem

&emsp;&emsp;The root (/) of the filesystem is at the top of the tree, and the following are the most important subdirectories to know:

* `/root`: The home directory of the all-powerful root user
* `/etc`: Generally contains the Linux configuration files—files that control when and how programs start up
* `/home`: The user’s home directory
