# 1 Getting Started with HTML

## 1.1 What is HTML?

&emsp;&emsp;HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages we visit.

&emsp;&emsp;HTML consists of a series of elements, which we use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:

```
My cat is very grumpy
```

&emsp;&emsp;If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph `<p>` element:

```html
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```

## 1.2 Anatomy of an HTML element

The anatomy of our element is:

* The **opening tag**: Marks where the element begins or starts to take effect.
* The **content**: The content of the element.
* The **closing tag**: Marks where the element ends.

The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.
