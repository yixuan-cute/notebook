# 1 Getting Started

## 1.1 Print the Worlds: hello, world

1. Write the codes.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

2. Compile it with gcc and execute it.

```bash
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
```

## 2.1 Variable Names

&emsp;&emsp;Names are made up of letters and digits; the first character must be a letter. The underscore `_` counts as a letter; it is sometimes useful for improving the readability of long variable names. Don't begin variable names with underscore, however, since library routines often use such names.

&emsp;&emsp;Upper case and lower case letters are distinct, so **x** and **X** are two different names. Traditional C practice is to use lower case for variable names, and all upper case for sysmbolic constants.
